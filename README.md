# SDHacks2019
These are some notes that I would like to implement soon for this project.


Communication
--------------
- Users should be able to communicate with ease. This improves UX/UI. 
- Focus on simplicity and consistency. 
- We can add chatboxes with AIs and real life representatives. 
- Main foucus is communication.

Functionalities
---------------
- Sleep data analysis and fitness analysis. 
- Should we implement diet as well?
- All data should be a factor into an overall health score. This health score is the main function of our service because it incorporates data from other health related stuff and generates how well are you doing physically and mentally.

* Currently in the process of thinking of other stuff but this is what I have for now. I'll edit this soon *


APIs
-----
- AWS Chat box (for communication purposes)
- AWS forcast (this is a difficult one because Amazon said they barely implemented this. There's not good documentation, so this is pretty difficult but for sure I want to implement this)
